# Welcome to Uvicore

The Full Stack Asynchronous Python Framework with the performance of FastAPI and the elegance of Laravel!

## About Uvicore

Uvicore is a fullstack async API, Web and CLI python framework.  Uvicore is built on great technologies such as:

- Simple and fast routing engine thanks to FastAPI and Starlette.
- Full Async/Await python everywhere, even at the CLI thanks to AsyncClick.
- Powerful IoC container so your App controls the framework and can override anything.
- Adapter pattens for multiple backends to caching, auth, events, databases and more.
- Robust modular and deep-merged config system across uvicore modules.
- Custom and expressive ORM built on top of SQLAlchemy Core.

Uvicore is the missing Async fullstack framework that feels and performs like FastAPI.
