## About Uvicore

Uvicore is a fullstack async API, Web and CLI python framework.  Uvicore is built on great technologies such as:

- Blazing fast dual routing engine based on [FastAPI](https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi) and [Starlette](https://github.com/encode/starlette)!
- Await all the things, even your CLI's thanks to [AsyncClick](https://github.com/python-trio/asyncclick)!
- Powerful **IoC container!** Full control to your app! Override everything!
- Adapter pattens for multiple backends to caching, auth, events, databases and more.
- Robust modular and deep-merged config system across uvicore modules.
- Custom and expressive ORM built on top of [SQLAlchemy Core](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/core/).
