# Welcome to Uvicore

The Fullstack Async Web, API and CLI Python Framework


## Why Uvicore?

Fullstack, Modular and Asynchronous. A Full Solution for Web, API and CLI Development.

Micro frameworks are great!  They become the building blocks for larger structures and fullstack frameworks.  Starlette and FastAPI for example are fantastic building blocks.  But most projects require structure, standards and many libraries and layers that work together.

Uvicore is the missing fullstack framework for elegant


## Inspiration

- Heavily inspired by the amazing PHP Laravel Framework.
- Uvicore utilizes Starlette as the "web" router.
- Uvicore utilizes FastAPI as the "api" router and OpenAPI document generation.
- Uvicore utilizes smurfix/asyncclick for full async CLIs that can await your existing async methods.
- Uvicore utilizes SQLAlchemy "core" and encode/databases, but adds its own custom ORM for elegant queries and objects.
